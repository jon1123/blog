# This is my study blog 

Hi, I’m Jon. I’m a cybersecurity professional with a background in IT support and technical auditing, now focused on offensive security and penetration testing. I enjoy building labs, breaking things (ethically!), and sharing what I learn along the way. This site is where I document my progress, projects, and studies in cybersecurity — from HackTheBox and HomeLab write-ups to thoughts on security trends
