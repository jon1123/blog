### This is my study blog 

Hello I am Jon Kuhl

I have been studding IT and penetration testing for the last few of years and am looking for work in that field. I know there is still so much to learn. Last year I took and passed the eJPT v1. and I am currently working on HTB Academy.
I plan on adding my wright-ups on the recommended boxes that accompany the modules I am working on or recently finished. As well as some TryHackMe.com and other CTF's and maybe some home-lab or other projects.

As you may notices if you notices such things I am dyslexic and may miss some misspellings or other gamer errors. This is a fact of my life that I am always working on so you may let me know of them and in time they will be corrected. 

Thank you.
